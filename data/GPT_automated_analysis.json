      "461": "This project aims to improve four major areas identified by FDA, including transcription, translation, document and evidence management, and co-working space. Automatic speech recognition has been widely used in many applications. Its cutting-edge technology is transformer-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model, which is trained to generate transcripts autoregressively and has been fine-tuned on certain datasets. Using pre-trained language models directly may not be suitable because they might not work properly with different accents and specialized regulatory and scientific terminologies. This is because the models were trained on a specific type of data and may not be able to handle data that is significantly different from what they were trained on. To address this, researchers plan to manually read a set of video/audio to obtain their true transcripts, upon which they fine-tune the model to make it adapt to this new domain. Machine translation converts a sequence of text from one language to another. Researchers usually use a method called \"seq2seq,\" where original text is codified into a language that a computer can understand. Then, we use this code to generate the translated version of the text. It's like a translator who listens to someone speak in one language and then repeats what they said in another language. Similarly, it is not appropriate to directly apply the existing pre-trained seq2seq models, because (a) some languages used in the FDA context might not exist in existing models. (b) domain specific terms used in FDA are very different from general human languages. To tackle these challenges, models are trained for some unusual languages and fine-tune pre-trained models for major languages.

The main agricultural problems can be classified into five categories, as explained below: (1) Disease Detection and Classification: The project will develop experts who will solve problems in disease identification using machine vision for most of the diseases in crops and livestock, which are misdiagnosed by farmers. (2) Weed Classification: The project will develop algorithms that accurately identify weeds and contribute to the growing scientific database for automatic weed detection. (3) Pest Detection and Classification: Appropriate tools using machine vision for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are needed in Tanzania, as IPM has been hindered due to a lack of extension officers to train farmers on mitigation and identification of pests in agriculture.

Also of importance are algorithms to sort and estimate yield by counting the fruits and to estimate the amount of other agricultural products. (5) Crop Vigor Estimation: Most farmers apply inputs evenly across the farm because they cannot predetermine crop vigor.

The ability to predict placental permeability of chemicals during pregnancy is an important factor that can inform regulatory decisions related to fetal safety and clinical trials with women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). The human placenta contains transport proteins, which facilitate the transfer of various endogenous substances and xenobiotics. Several mechanisms allow this transfer: i) passive diffusion, ii) active transport, iii) facilitated diffusion, iv) pinocytosis, and v) phagocytosis. Among these, passive and active transport are the two major routes. Small, non-ionized, highly lipophilic drugs cross the placenta via passive diffusion; however, relatively large molecules (MW > 500 Da) with low lipophilicity are carried by transporters. While prediction of the ability of drugs to cross the placenta via diffusion is straight-forward, the complexity of molecular interactions between drugs and transporters has proven to be a challenging problem to solve. Virtually, all QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) published to date model small datasets (usually not exceeding 100 drugs) and utilize weak validation strategies [1-5].\nIn this proposal, 3D-molecular similarities of endogenous placental transporter ligands to known drug substrates will be used to identify the most likely mode of drug transportation (active/passive) and build predictive, quantitative and categorical 3D-SDAR models by linking their molecular characteristics to placental permeability. Permeability data will be collected via mining the literature, the CDER databases, and conducting empirical assessments using in vitro NAMs with confirmation using rodent models. Predictability will be validated using: i) blind test sets including known controls and ii) a small set of drugs with unknown permeabilities, which will be tested in in vitro and in vivo models.",

Among these, the toxicological response is the most challenging task due to its immense complexity involving multiple pathways and protein targets. Although many adverse drug reactions (ADRs) result from genetic polymorphisms and factors such as the patient's medical history and the treatment dosage and regimen, on a fundamental level all ADRs are initiated by the binding of a drug molecule to a target, whether intended (therapeutic target) or non-intended (off-target interactions with promiscuous proteins) [7]. While molecular similarity approaches designed to identify off-target interaction sites have been explored since the late 2000s [8, 9], most have been focused on drug design, repurposing and more generally, efficacy, whereas relatively few have been applied to toxicology [10, 11].\nSince there are multiple approaches to molecular similarity (structural, functional, whole molecule, pharmacophore, etc. [12]), the performance of any of the above applications depends strongly on the metrics by which similarity is quantified. For the past 10 years, DSB has been working on creating a universal molecular modeling approach utilizing unique three-dimensional fingerprints encoding both the steric and electrostatic fields governing the interactions between ligands and receptors. It has been demonstrated that these fingerprints could quantify reliably both the structural and functional similarities between molecules [13, 14] and their application for prediction of adverse events from AI generated drug - endogenous ligand - target networks could provide new insights into yet unknown mechanisms of toxicity.",

These methods are not applicable when two or more reporting measures (e.g. gender, age, race, etc.) must be considered and compared.

Therefore, analysis of semantic relationships plays a vital role to extract useful information from the FDA documents to facilitate the regulatory science research and improve FDA product review process. The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an unprecedent opportunity to analyze the semantic text data by using the language models that are trained with large biomedical corpus. This study is to assess the AI based NLP for the FDA documents with a focus on the FDA labeling documents. Specifically, we will apply the publicly available language models (e.g., BERT and BioBERT) to the FDA drug labeling documents available from the FDA Label tool that manages over 120K labeling documents including over 40K Human Prescription Drug and Biological Products. We will investigate three areas of AI applications that are important to the regulatory science research: (1) the interpretation and classification of drug properties (e.g., safety and efficacy) with AI reading, (2) text summarization to provide highlights of labeling sections, (3) automatic anomaly analysis (AAA) for signal identification, and (4) information retrieval with Amazon-like Questions/Answer. We will compare the AI based NLP with MedDRA based approach whenever possible for drug safety and efficacy.

The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 of\u00a0\u223c0.8.

One of the key aspects of both regulatory applications is to understand the underlying features driving the AI performance and to the extension of its interpretability in the context of application.  \n \nDifferent from the statistical evaluation (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), model interpretability assessment lacks quantitative metrics. In most cases, the assessment tends to be subjective, where prior knowledge is often used as a ground-truth to explain the biological relevance of underlying features, e.g., whether the biomarkers featured by the model are in accordance with the existing findings. In reality, there is a trade-off between statistical performance and interpretability among different AI algorithms, and understanding the difference will improve the context of use of AI technologies in regulatory science.  \n\nFor that, we will investigate representative AI methods, in terms of their performance and interpretability, first through benchmark datasets that have been well-established in the research community, then extended to clinical/pre-clinical datasets.

While originally built for claims data, SCDM was expanded in 2015 to accommodate some information commonly found in EHRs in separate clinical data tables to capture laboratory test results of interest and vital signs. We selected the SCDM over other CDMs because data formatted in the SCDM enables analyses that can leverage the standardized active risk identification and analysis (ARIA) tools.

If not a known-good, determine if there are sightings of the indicator by cross-referencing organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. If there are no sightings for the indicator, determine if this indicator has been verified by an analyst within our organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. Lastly if the indicator has not been verified by an analyst, AS&F determines whether there are other reports within our organizational-centric intelligence about this indicator and classifies accordingly. AIS participants can triage against the populated opinion and/or confidence values to identify Indicator objects meeting or exceeding designated criteria and filter out the remaining data. AIS participants may also find value in utilizing the confidence score (if present) and the opinion value to understand whether any difference between the publisher and other organizations exists. Together, these enrichments can help those receiving information from AIS prioritize actioning and investigating Indicator objects.",

The system is now live and operational on the \nFlukebook platform for both North Atlantic and southern right whales. We have a paper in \nreview at Mammalian Biology.",
      "277": "Well casing pressure requests are submitted to BSEE to determine whether a well platform is experiencing a sustained casing pressure (SCP) problem. SCP is usually caused by gas migration from a high-pressured subsurface formation through the leaking cement sheath in one of the well\u2019s casing annuli, but SCP can also be caused by defects in tube connections, downhole accessories, or seals. Because SCP can lead to major safety issues, quickly identifying wells with SCP could greatly mitigate accidents on the well platforms. BSEE entered into an Inter-Agency Agreement with NASA's Advanced Supercomputing Division to help research the use of various AI techniques.",

Automatic speech recognition has been widely used in many applications. Its cutting-edge technology is transformer-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model, which is trained to generate transcripts autoregressively and has been fine-tuned on certain datasets. Using pre-trained language models directly may not be suitable because they might not work properly with different accents and specialized regulatory and scientific terminologies. This is because the models were trained on a specific type of data and may not be able to handle data that is significantly different from what they were trained on. To address this, researchers plan to manually read a set of video/audio to obtain their true transcripts, upon which they fine-tune the model to make it adapt to this new domain. Machine translation converts a sequence of text from one language to another. Researchers usually use a method called \"seq2seq,\" where original text is codified into a language that a computer can understand. Then, we use this code to generate the translated version of the text. It's like a translator who listens to someone speak in one language and then repeats what they said in another language. Similarly, it is not appropriate to directly apply the existing pre-trained seq2seq models, because (a) some languages used in the FDA context might not exist in existing models. (b) domain specific terms used in FDA are very different from general human languages. To tackle these challenges, models are trained for some unusual languages and fine-tune pre-trained models for major languages. For both situations, researchers prepare high-quality training set labeled by experts. University of Maryland CERSI (M-CERSI) plans to build a system to manage different documents and evidence, by implementing three sub-systems: (a) document classifier, (b) video/audio classifier, and (c) an interactive middleware that connects the trained model at the backend and the input at the frontend. With this, all documents created during co-working can be shared and accessed by all participants.",

The main agricultural problems can be classified into five categories, as explained below: (1) Disease Detection and Classification: The project will develop experts who will solve problems in disease identification using machine vision for most of the diseases in crops and livestock, which are misdiagnosed by farmers. (2) Weed Classification: The project will develop algorithms that accurately identify weeds and contribute to the growing scientific database for automatic weed detection. (3) Pest Detection and Classification: Appropriate tools using machine vision for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are needed in Tanzania, as IPM has been hindered due to a lack of extension officers to train farmers on mitigation and identification of pests in agriculture. (4) Crop Seedlings Stand Count and Yield Estimation: Use of machine vision and drones instead of scouting manually to estimate stand counts would provide appropriate mitigation strategies for replanting that would be beneficial to commercial farmers. Also of importance are algorithms to sort and estimate yield by counting the fruits and to estimate the amount of other agricultural products. (5) Crop Vigor Estimation: Most farmers apply inputs evenly across the farm because they cannot predetermine crop vigor. Accurate estimation of crop health would help farmers to mitigate the problems earlier and improve crop performance and avoid failure. Algorithms to determine crop vigor developed in this project will contribute to the improvement of the methods to estimate crop performance earlier.",

The ability to predict placental permeability of chemicals during pregnancy is an important factor that can inform regulatory decisions related to fetal safety and clinical trials with women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). The human placenta contains transport proteins, which facilitate the transfer of various endogenous substances and xenobiotics. Several mechanisms allow this transfer: i) passive diffusion, ii) active transport, iii) facilitated diffusion, iv) pinocytosis, and v) phagocytosis. Among these, passive and active transport are the two major routes. Small, non-ionized, highly lipophilic drugs cross the placenta via passive diffusion; however, relatively large molecules (MW > 500 Da) with low lipophilicity are carried by transporters. While prediction of the ability of drugs to cross the placenta via diffusion is straight-forward, the complexity of molecular interactions between drugs and transporters has proven to be a challenging problem to solve. Virtually, all QSARs (Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships) published to date model small datasets (usually not exceeding 100 drugs) and utilize weak validation strategies [1-5].\nIn this proposal, 3D-molecular similarities of endogenous placental transporter ligands to known drug substrates will be used to identify the most likely mode of drug transportation (active/passive) and build predictive, quantitative and categorical 3D-SDAR models by linking their molecular characteristics to placental permeability. Permeability data will be collected via mining the literature, the CDER databases, and conducting empirical assessments using in vitro NAMs with confirmation using rodent models.

Among these, the toxicological response is the most challenging task due to its immense complexity involving multiple pathways and protein targets. Although many adverse drug reactions (ADRs) result from genetic polymorphisms and factors such as the patient's medical history and the treatment dosage and regimen, on a fundamental level all ADRs are initiated by the binding of a drug molecule to a target, whether intended (therapeutic target) or non-intended (off-target interactions with promiscuous proteins) [7]. While molecular similarity approaches designed to identify off-target interaction sites have been explored since the late 2000s [8, 9], most have been focused on drug design, repurposing and more generally, efficacy, whereas relatively few have been applied to toxicology [10, 11].\nSince there are multiple approaches to molecular similarity (structural, functional, whole molecule, pharmacophore, etc. [12]), the performance of any of the above applications depends strongly on the metrics by which similarity is quantified. For the past 10 years, DSB has been working on creating a universal molecular modeling approach utilizing unique three-dimensional fingerprints encoding both the steric and electrostatic fields governing the interactions between ligands and receptors. It has been demonstrated that these fingerprints could quantify reliably both the structural and functional similarities between molecules [13, 14] and their application for prediction of adverse events from AI generated drug - endogenous ligand - target networks could provide new insights into yet unknown mechanisms of toxicity.",

Important sex differences have been observed in POU-associated cardiac endpoints. Currently, systematic knowledge is lacking for risk factors associated with the increased cardiotoxicity of POU in women. 2) Currently, the FDA utilizes two methods of analysis for data mining, the Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) and the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) to identify significant statistical associations between products and adverse events (AEs). These methods are not applicable when two or more reporting measures (e.g. gender, age, race, etc.) must be considered and compared.

Reservoirs are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) activities and runoff because of their complex dynamics, relatively longer water residence times, and their role as an integrating sink for pollutants from their drainage basins.

To advance data acquisition for LULC analysis and climate change, the study utilizes optical Earth-observation and meteorological satellite data.

In this study, chemical structure and physicochemical properties were used to predict the probability that a chemical might be associated with any of four exposure pathways leading from sources-consumer (near-field), dietary, far-field industrial, and far-field pesticide-to the general population. The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 of\u00a0\u223c0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479 926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 \u03bcg/kg BW/day for 474572 compounds.\nConsensus Modeling of Median Chemical Intake for the U.S. Population Based on Predictions of Exposure Pathways",

Opioid use disorder (OUD) often starts with use of prescription opioid analgesics. Therefore, the development of abuse-deterrent analgesic products may significantly impact the trajectory of the opioid crisis. In addition, FDA is making new efforts to support novel product innovation for pain management and the treatment of OUD to combat this opioid crisis. \nOpioid agonists bind and activate opioid receptors to decrease calcium influx and  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), leading to hyperpolarization that inhibits pain transmission. Opioid antagonists bind and inhibit or block opioid receptors. Both opioid agonists and antagonists are used in drug products for pain management and treatment of opioid addiction. An opioid agonists/antagonists knowledgebase (OAK) would be useful for FDA reviewers to inform evaluation and to assist development of analgesics and of additional treatments for OUD.\nTo create a comprehensive OAK, we propose to curate the experimental data on opioid agonist/antagonist activity from the public domain, experimentally test some 2800 drugs in functional opioid receptor assays using quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) platform, and develop and validate in silico models to predict opioid agonist/antagonist activity. The created OAK knowledgebase could be used for retrieving experimental opioid agonist/antagonist activity data and the related experimental protocols. For chemicals without experimental data, read-across methods could be used to find similar chemicals in OAK to estimate the opioid agonist/antagonist activity, and the in silico models in OAK could be used to predict the opioid agonist/antagonist activity.

It learns from existing data/information to predict future outcomes, distill knowledge, offer advices, or plan action steps. The rise of AI has offered both opportunities and challenges to FDA in two aspects: (1) how to assess and evaluate marketed AI-centric products and (2) how to implement AI methods to improve the agency's operation. One of the key aspects of both regulatory applications is to understand the underlying features driving the AI performance and to the extension of its interpretability in the context of application.  \n \nDifferent from the statistical evaluation (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity and specificity), model interpretability assessment lacks quantitative metrics. In most cases, the assessment tends to be subjective, where prior knowledge is often used as a ground-truth to explain the biological relevance of underlying features, e.g., whether the biomarkers featured by the model are in accordance with the existing findings. In reality, there is a trade-off between statistical performance and interpretability among different AI algorithms, and understanding the difference will improve the context of use of AI technologies in regulatory science.  \n\nFor that, we will investigate representative AI methods, in terms of their performance and interpretability, first through benchmark datasets that have been well-established in the research community, then extended to clinical/pre-clinical datasets. This project will provide basic parameters and offer an insightful guidance on developing explainable AI models to facilitate the real-world decision making in regulatory settings.",

As a result, a wealth of animal data is available from the public domain and other sources. As the toxicology community and regulatory agencies move towards a reduction, refinement, and replacement (3Rs principle) of animal studies, we proposed an AI-based generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to learn from existing animal studies so that it can generate animal data for new and untested chemicals without conducting further animal experiments. The FDA has developed guidelines and frameworks to modernize toxicity assessment with alternative methods, such as the FDA Predictive Toxicology Roadmap and the Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND). These programs facilitate the development and evaluation of alternative methodologies to expand the FDA's toxicology predictive capabilities, to reduce the use of animal testing, and to facilitate drug development.

Using Crimson Hexagon\u2019s machine learning algorithm, \u201cBrightview,\u201d publicly available social media content originating in the countries of interest was scraped by the algorithm, for posts relevant to RH/FP and youth. The resulting social media posts were then classified by topic, using language detected in the content. This provided a dataset categorizing conversations into overarching topics, allowing analyses to uncover key trends in topic specific conversation volume, insights about misinformation, attitudes and social norms, and more. The machine learning algorithm was able to identify relevant social media content. The 12,301 social media posts were qualitatively assessed and categorized, allowing researchers to monitor and track social media conversations far more expansively than allowed by research methods more traditionally used in public health and SBC programs.",

If not a known-good, determine if there are sightings of the indicator by cross-referencing organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. If there are no sightings for the indicator, determine if this indicator has been verified by an analyst within our organizational-centric intelligence and classify accordingly if true. Lastly if the indicator has not been verified by an analyst, AS&F determines whether there are other reports within our organizational-centric intelligence about this indicator and classifies accordingly. AIS participants can triage against the populated opinion and/or confidence values to identify Indicator objects meeting or exceeding designated criteria and filter out the remaining data.

This system utilizes software called Matroid to analyze photographs taken by field imaging equipment. The purpose of this analysis is to determine if any of the images contain human subjects. \n\nThis relates to the theme of \"Law and Justice\" because the ICAD system plays a crucial role in investigations related to border control and immigration. By analyzing the photographs, USBP agents can identify and potentially apprehend individuals who may be involved in illegal activities or crossing the border unlawfully. Therefore, the software and its usage in this context highlight the importance of maintaining law and justice at the borders.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions the goal of expanding the system's models to include vehicles and subjects with long-arm rifles, while excluding animals or items of little interest. This indicates the ongoing efforts to improve the system's ability to identify potential threats and enforce the law effectively.\n\nHence, the theme \"Law and Justice\" is relevant in the given text as it involves investigations, forensics (through photograph analysis), and the topic of border control, which all tie back to maintaining lawfulness and justice.",

This proactive monitoring and investigation are part of the US government's efforts to ensure fair trade and protect its domestic industries.\\n\\nTherefore, the text highlights the relevance of the theme \\\"Diplomacy and Trade\\\" by demonstrating how trade policies, investigation processes, and monitoring mechanisms are implemented to regulate international commerce and maintain fair trade practices.\",\"GSA-0000-2023\":null,\"DOE-0067-2023\":null,\"DOS-0017-2023\":null,\"DOE-0163-2023\":null,\"USDA-0028-2023\":null,\"DOE-0121-2023\":null,\"NARA-0002-2023\":null,\"DOC-0009-2023\":null,\"SSA-0007-2023\":null,\"DOS-0009-2023\":null,\"DOC-0000-2023\":null,\"DOT-0002-2023\":null,\"DOS-0000-2023\":null,\"USDA-0013-2023\":null,\"NASA-0010-2023\":null,\"DOE-0034-2023\":null,\"DOE-0044-2023\":null,\"HHS-0056-2023\":null,\"DOS-0022-2023\":null,\"DHS-0030-2023\":null,\"DHS-0000-2023\":null,\"NARA-0003-2023\":null,\"DHS-0022-2023\":null,\"DOE-0092-2023\":null,\"DOI-0034-2023\":null,\"DOC-0024-2023\":null,\"HHS-0116-2023\":null,\"DOE-0063-2023\":null,\"TREAS-0011-2023\":null,\"HHS-0064-2023\":null,\"DHS-0036-2023\":null,\"VA-0018-2023\":null,\"HHS-0123-2023\":null,\"DOT-0007-2023\":null,\"USDA-0010-2023\":null,\"SSA-0013-2023\":null,\"DOI-0010-2023\":null,\"HHS-0011-2023\":null,\"DOE-0103-2023\":null,\"DHS-0006-2023\":null,\"HHS-0081-2023\":null,\"DHS-0026-2023\":null,\"HHS-0129-2023\":null,\"NASA-0000-2023\":null,\"HHS-0105-2023\":null,\"HHS-0059-2023\":null,\"HHS-0087-2023\":null,\"HHS-0050-2023\":null,\"EPA-0001-2023\":null,\"HHS-0096-2023\":null,\"VA-0028-2023\":null,\"VA-0012-2023\":null,\"DOC-0033-2023\":null,\"HHS-0061-2023\":null,\"DOC-0037-2023\":null,\"HHS-0062-2023\":null,\"USDA-0037-2023\":null,\"HHS-0005-2023\":null,\"HHS-0013-2023\":null,\"DOI-0033-2023\":null,\"DOE-0003-2023\":null,\"DHS-0010-2023\":null,\"DOS-0028-2023\":null,\"DOE-0109-2023\":null,\"DOL-0014-2023\":null,\"DOI-0028-2023\":null,\"TREAS-0006-2023\":null,\"DOL-0007-2023\":null,\"DHS-0034-2023\":null,\"NASA-0019-2023\":null,\"USAID-0000-2023\":null,\"HHS-0004-2023\":null,\"DOE-0046-2023\":null,\"DOI-0027-2023\":null,\"DOJ-0003-2023\":null,\"DOE-0073-2023\":null,\"HHS-0069-2023\":null,\"NASA-0028-2023\":null,\"DOE-0149-2023\":null,\"DOT-0011-2023\":null,\"DOE-0122-2023\":null,\"VA-0015-2023\":null,\"HHS-0048-2023\":null,\"DOE-0129-2023\":null,\"DOE-0167-2023\":null,\"DOI-0011-2023\":null,\"HHS-0141-2023\":null,\"DOE-0024-2023\":null,\"DOE-0136-2023\":null,\"DOI-0030-2023\":null,\"SSA-0006-2023\":null,\"DHS-0013-2023\":null,\"USDA-0008-2023\":null,\"DOE-0041-2023\":null,\"DOT-0013-2023\":null,\"DOC-0015-2023\":null,\"DOS-0018-2023\":null,\"NASA-0012-2023\":null,\"DOI-0021-2023\":null,\"DOL-0011-2023\":null,\"HHS-0043-2023\":null,\"NASA-0024-2023\":null,\"USDA-0017-2023\":null,\"DOE-0177-2023\":null,\"NASA-0007-2023\":null,\"DOE-0007-2023\":null,\"HHS-0124-2023\":null,\"NASA-0001-2023\":null,\"DOE-0023-2023\":null,\"DOE-0043-2023\":null,\"DOE-0078-2023\":null,\"DOE-0119-2023\":null,\"HHS-0139-2023\":null,\"SSA-0003-2023\":null,\"HHS-0022-2023\":null,\"USDA-0036-2023\":null,\"VA-0009-2023\":null,\"DOE-0176-2023\":null,\"NASA-0017-2023\":null,\"HHS-0147-2023\":null,\"DOE-0005-2023\":null,\"HHS-0145-2023\":null,\"DOE-0059-2023\":null,\"HHS-0136-2023\":null,\"DOC-0034-2023\":null,\"DOC-0035-2023\":null,\"DOE-0032-2023\":null,\"DOE-0011-2023\":null,\"HHS-0076-2023\":null,\"DHS-0037-2023\":null,\"HHS-0104-2023\":null,\"DOE-0168-2023\":null,\"DOE-0025-2023\":null,\"DOE-0175-2023\":null,\"DHS-0025-2023\":null,\"DOC-0012-2023\":null,\"HHS-0152-2023\":null,\"DOE-0020-2023\":null,\"TREAS-0007-2023\":null,\"TREAS-0001-2023\":null,\"HHS-0085-2023\":null,\"DHS-0008-2023\":null,\"HHS-0008-2023\":null,\"USDA-0021-2023\":null,\"NASA-0031-2023\":null,\"HHS-0112-2023\":null,\"DOE-0002-2023\":null,\"DOC-0013-2023\":null,\"DOE-0077-2023\":null,\"DOC-0025-2023\":null,\"VA-0029-2023\":null,\"DOE-0070-2023\":null,\"DOE-0039-2023\":null,\"HHS-0128-2023\":null,\"DOE-0010-2023\":null,\"DHS-0014-2023\":null,\"SSA-0001-2023\":null,\"NASA-0029-2023\":null,\"DOE-0125-2023\":null,\"VA-0027-2023\":null,\"HHS-0142-2023\":null,\"USAID-0008-2023\":null,\"DOS-0012-2023\":null,\"DOS-0024-2023\":null,\"DOE-0164-2023\":null,\"DOE-0162-2023\":null,\"USAID-0006-2023\":null,\"DOC-0029-2023\":null,\"HHS-0031-2023\":null,\"HHS-0132-2023\":null,\"HHS-0063-2023\":null,\"DHS-0039-2023\":null,\"DOJ-0000-2023\":null,\"VA-0019-2023\":null,\"DOE-0065-2023\":null,\"DOE-0153-2023\":null,\"DOE-0134-2023\":null,\"HHS-0154-2023\":null,\"VA-0022-2023\":null,\"DHS-0028-2023\":null,\"USAID-0007-2023\":null,\"HHS-0028-2023\":null,\"DOE-0017-2023\":null,\"DOC-0039-2023\":null,\"DOC-0002-2023\":\"This text is relevant to the theme of \\\"Diplomacy and Trade\\\" because it discusses the Consolidated Screening List (CSL), which is a tool used by the US Government to control and restrict certain exports, reexports, or transfers of items.
