Case Recording summarization,Using an open source large language model to summarize publicly available case recording documents which are void of personal identifiable information (PII) or any other sensitive information. This is not hosted in the DOL technical environment and is reviewed by human note takers.,Development and Acquisition,Large language summarization model
OEWS Occupation Autocoder,The input is state submitted response files that include occupation title and sometimes job description of the surveyed units. The autocoder reads the job title and assigns up to two 6-digit Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes along with their probabilities as recommendations for human coders. Codes above a certain threshold are appended to the submitted response file and sent back to states to assist them with their SOC code assignment.,Operation and Maintenance,"Natural Langauge Processing, Logistic Regression, Classification"
Scanner Data Product Classification,"BLS receives bulk data from some corporations related to the cost of goods they sell and services they provide. Consumer Price Index (CPI) staff have hand-coded a segment of the items in these data into Entry Level Item (ELI) codes. To accept and make use of these bulk data transfers at scale, BLS has begun to use machine learning to label data with ELI codes. The machine learning model takes as input word frequency counts from item descriptions. Logistic regression is then used to estimate the probability of each item being classified in each ELI category based on the word frequency categorizations. The highest probability category is selected for inclusion in the data. Any selected classifications that do not meet a certain probability threshold are flagged for human review.",Operation and Maintenance,"Natural Langauge Processing, Logistic Regression, Classification"
Expenditure Classification Autocoder,Custom machine learning model to assign a reported expense description from Consumer Expenditure Diary Survey respondents to expense classification categories known as item codes.,Development and Acquisition,"Natural Language Processing, Random Forest, Classification"
