"Automated sorting of high repetition 
rate coherent diffraction data from 
XFELS","Brookhaven National 
Laboratory","""Coherent X-rays are routinely provided today by the latest Synchrotron 
and X-ray Free-electron Laser Sources. When these diffract from a 
crystal containing defects, interference leads to the formation of a 
modulated diffraction pattern called """"speckle"""". When the defects move 
around, they can be quantified by a correlation analysis technique called 
X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. But the speckles also change 
when the beam moves on the sample. By scanning the beam in a 
controlled way, the overlap between the adjacent regions gives 
redundancy to the data, which allows a solution of the inherent phase 
problem. This is the basis of the coherent X-ray ptychography method 
which can achieve image resolutions of 10nm, but only if the probe 
positions are known.
The goal of this proposal will be to separate """"genuine"""" fluctuations of a

rates of XFELs. Algorithms will be developed to calculate the 
correlations between all the coherent diffraction patterns arriving in a

fracture is coming.","National Energy Technology 
Laboratory","This project will develop an ML algorithm to predict the time when a 
growing fracture will reach the monitored well. The ML workflow will be 
trained on the distinctive tensile strain signature that precedes the 
growing fracture. The new workflow will be designed to work in 
conjunction with the fracture warning ML workflow developed in EY21. 
Together, these workflows will: (1) provide an early warning of well-to-
well communication, (2) predict the measured depths where the 
communication will happen, and (3) provide an estimated time until the 
beginning of well-to-well communication.",,"Neural Networks,

assist in automated analysis of 
sensor data taken during 
experiments on the MHD test 
channel.","National Energy Technology 
Laboratory","The measurements of chemical composition will be combined with 
resistance measurements to validate CFD models of the MHD channel 
system. Specifically, validated CFD models will be able to separate the 
contribution of the bulk and boundary layer resistance to the overall 
resistance of the MHD channel.",,Other
