Gender differentiated credit scoring,"Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI)","University of California, Berkeley, is building a machine learning model to conduct gender differentiated credit scoring for customers of Rappicard in Mexico. They will compare this ML model to Rappi's ""status quo"" model to determine whether a gender differentiated model leads to greater access to credit for women.",Initiation,XGBoost algorithm with parameters tuned via random hyperparameter search using 5-fold cross validation on the training dataset for 60 iterations (resulting in at least a 95% chance of finding a hyperparameter combination in the best 5% of combinations). The scores resulting from the XGBoost are calibrated via Platt scaling so that model scores can be interpreted as default probabilities. These is standard method for training credit scoring algorithms in the industry.
Using ML for predicting treatment interruption among PLHIV in Nigeria,Bureau for Global Health (GH),"Using data from USAID funded Strengthening Integrated Delivery of HIV/AIDS Services (SIDHAS) project in Nigeria we trained and tested an algorithm that can be used for predicting the probability that someone newly initiated on ART will interrupt treatment. The algorithm has been successfully integrated into the Lafiya Management Information System (LAMIS), the individual-level client level electronic medical record system. Each week the outputs, for each new patient is shared with staff at the health facilities and those at high risk are provided with more intensive follow up support to reduce the risk of treatment interruption. We also conducted a qualitative assessment among to health care workers at the facilities to determine their perception of ML and determine what additional support are required for institutionalizing ML into their routine work.

Long-term impacts of land-use/land-cover dynamics on surface water quality in Botswana’s reservoirs using satellite data and artificial intelligence methods: Case study of the Botswana’s Limpopo River Basin (1984-2019),"Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI)","For water supply, semi-arid Botswana relies on the reservoirs within the Botswana’s LRB. Reservoirs are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) activities and runoff because of their complex dynamics, relatively longer water residence times, and their role as an integrating sink for pollutants from their drainage basins. Despite these interrelationships and significance in regional and global economic stability, land and water (L-W) are often treated in “silos”. To understand the complex L-W nexus within the LRB, this study will use data-driven artificial intelligence for quantitative determination of the relationships between LULC change, together with socioeconomic development indicators and climate change, and their impacts on water quality and availability within the basin, both for 1984-2019 and to predict future scenarios (2020-2050). To advance data acquisition for LULC analysis and climate change, the study utilizes optical Earth-observation and meteorological satellite data. To provide near real-time and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of reservoir water quality within the basin, the study will develop empirical models for water quality estimation and water quality index mapping using 35-years of in-situ water quality measurements and water spectral observations using drone-borne spectrometer and optical satellite imagery through regression modeling and geospatial methods.",Development and Acquisition,
Morogoro youth empowerment through establishment of social innovation (YEESI) lab for problem-centered training in machine vision,"Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI)","The project proposes to establish a social innovation lab for a machine vision program that will be used by youth in the Morogoro region of Tanzania. There are young people in the area who have studied information technologies and allied sciences, and while most of them can write computer programs, they cannot solve machine vision problems. This project aims to increase awareness among the youth of Morogoro and nearby regions to address machine vision problems in agriculture. Machine vision is a new and understudied practice in Tanzania; hence, this project will contribute to efforts in the creation of scientific societies that address the most pressing problems faced by more than 80% of Tanzania’s population who engage in farming. The main agricultural problems can be classified into five categories, as explained below: (1) Disease Detection and Classification: The project will develop experts who will solve problems in disease identification using machine vision for most of the diseases in crops and livestock, which are misdiagnosed by farmers. (2) Weed Classification: The project will develop algorithms that accurately identify weeds and contribute to the growing scientific database for automatic weed detection. (3) Pest Detection and Classification: Appropriate tools using machine vision for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are needed in Tanzania, as IPM has been hindered due to a lack of extension officers to train farmers on mitigation and identification of pests in agriculture. (4) Crop Seedlings Stand Count and Yield Estimation: Use of machine vision and drones instead of scouting manually to estimate stand counts would provide appropriate mitigation strategies for replanting that would be beneficial to commercial farmers. Also of importance are algorithms to sort and estimate yield by counting the fruits and to estimate the amount of other agricultural products. (5) Crop Vigor Estimation: Most farmers apply inputs evenly across the farm because they cannot predetermine crop vigor. Accurate estimation of crop health would help farmers to mitigate the problems earlier and improve crop performance and avoid failure. Algorithms to determine crop vigor developed in this project will contribute to the improvement of the methods to estimate crop performance earlier.",Development and Acquisition,
Breakthrough RESEARCH’s Social Media Listening,Bureau for Global Health (GH),"Social media listening draws on machine learning to synthesize and organize the vast quantities of data shared over social media platforms. Breakthrough RESEARCH carried out social listening on 12,301 social media posts in Nigeria to explore how gender-related online conversations manifest themselves and whether they have changed in the last five years. Using Crimson Hexagon’s machine learning algorithm, “Brightview,” publicly available social media content originating in the countries of interest was scraped by the algorithm, for posts relevant to RH/FP and youth. The resulting social media posts were then classified by topic, using language detected in the content. This provided a dataset categorizing conversations into overarching topics, allowing analyses to uncover key trends in topic specific conversation volume, insights about misinformation, attitudes and social norms, and more. The machine learning algorithm was able to identify relevant social media content. The 12,301 social media posts were qualitatively assessed and categorized, allowing researchers to monitor and track social media conversations far more expansively than allowed by research methods more traditionally used in public health and SBC programs.",Operation and Maintenance,

NASA SERVIR - Bias Correcting Historical GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Service (GESS) data using Machine Learning (ML) Techniques,Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean,"GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Service (GESS) helps to organize the international community engaged in the hydrologic sciences, observations, and their application to forecasting and provides a forum for government-to-government collaboration, and engagement with the academic and private sectors to achieve the delivery of actionable water information. Since the formal creation of the initiative in 2017, the most significant element of GEOGloWS has been the application of Earth Observations (EO) to create a system that forecasts flow on every river of the world while also providing a 40-year simulated historical flow.

This application uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model with the time series of discharge data to bias correct the globally available GESS discharge information locally.",Development and Acquisition,
