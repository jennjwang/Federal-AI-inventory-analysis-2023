Title,Summary,Development Stage
"Account Management 
Chatbot","The Accounts Management Chatbot leverages a natural language 
understanding model within the eGain intent engine. This NLU maps 
utterances to a specific intents, and returns the appropriate knowledge 
article.",Operation and Maintenance
"Appeals Case 
Memorandum","The Appeals Case Memorandum (ACM) leverages natural language 
processing capabilities to assist with extraction, consolidation, and labeling 
of unstructured text from IRS ACM documents, automatic identification of 
key information, and processing results into a structured format. The 
outcome of this processes is for IRS staff to review appeals information for 
insights, which can be used upstream to enhance case quality, consistency, 
and performance. Summary of results involve detailed analysis on text 
relationships, issues, and citation narrative text paragraphs to provide 
insight on issues commonly adjusted during the appeals process.",Implementation
"Coin quality inspection 
system","Automated coin visual inspection tools to search for defects on production 
lines. Currently each coining press operator manually inspects coins for 
quality. Improve quality and eliminate waste.  Researching feasibility and 
tools.",Initiation
Collection Chat Bot,"The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model will be located inside 
the eGain intent engine. This NLU will take customer typed text input aka 
– Utterances.  It will map the utterance to a specific intent and return the 
appropriate knowledge article.",In production: less than six months
Collection Voice Bot,"The Nuance Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model will be located 
inside the Automated Collections IVR (ACI) main menu. This NLU will take 
customer speech input aka – Utterances.  It will map the utterance to a 
specific intent and direct the taxpayer down to a certain call path.",In production: less than six months
CX Analytics,"IRS' Customer Experience (CX) Analytics is a capability that uses multiple, 
customer service-related data sources to identify 
issues/anomalies/improvement opportunities across the customer service 
channel modes.",Implementation
DATA Act,"The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA) Act Bot automates 
verifying that IRS Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) reporting 
matches the information in contract documents (e.g. dollar amounts, 
dates, location of work). Natural language processing is used to extract 
unstructured information from contract documents. F1 scores are used to 
measure performance of validation models for each specific data element.",Planned (not in production)
"Inventory Item 
Replenishment MLR 
Modeling Pilot - Phase 1b","The Bureau of Engraving and Printing wanted to establish a proof of 
concept (POC) for Predictive Analytics at the BEP. This POC consisted of 
developing a Logistic Regression model for the Office of Supply Chain 
Management (OSCM), to predict whether an item would be delivered by 
the specified ""Need by Date"". This is the date that the BEP needs the 
material in its facility and is set automatically to 128 days when a purchase 
order (PO) is approved in the system. The model utilizes historical 
requisition, vendor, and item specific data to come up with binary (0 or 1) 
predictions, which are then used to determine whether an item will be 
delivered on-time or if the OSCM should expect a delay. If the model 
outputs a 1, we expect that the item will be delayed and the OSCM can be 
proactive in their decision making to prepare for a potential inventory 
shortage.",Development and Acquisition
"Inventory Item 
Replenishment MLR 
Modeling POC - Phase 1a","The Bureau of Engraving and Printing wanted to establish a proof of 
concept (POC) for Predictive Analytics at the BEP. This POC consisted of 
developing a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict Processing 
Lead Times for the Office of Supply Chain Management (OSCM). 
Processing Lead Times are the numbers of days it takes an item to be 
delivered to the target facility from the time the purchase order (PO) was 
approved. The model utilizes historical requisition, vendor, and item 
specific data to come up with numerical predictions, which are then used 
to determine whether an item will be delivered on-time or if the OSCM 
should expect a delay. If a delay is expected, the OSCM can be proactive in 
their decision making to prepare for a potential inventory shortage.",Development and Acquisition
"Inventory Item 
Replenishment MLR 
Modeling POC - Phase 2","The Bureau of Engraving and Printing wanted to operationalize a model 
using their newly deployed Cloudera Data Science Workbench (CDSW) 
application to predict whether an item would be delivered by the vendor 
Promised Date. This date is the date the vendor promises an item to be 
delivered to BEP. The model utilizes historical requisition, vendor, and 
item specific data to come up with binary (0 or 1) predictions, which are 
then used to determine whether an item will be delivered on-time or if the 
OSCM should expect a delay. If the model outputs a 1, we expect that the 
item will be delayed and the OSCM can be proactive in their decision 
making to prepare for a potential inventory shortage.",Development and Acquisition
NRP Redesign,"Deploy state-of-the-art AI machine learning methods to provide a lower 
opportunity cost method of estimating a compliance baseline to support 
tax gap estimation, improper payments reporting, development and 
validation of workload identification and selection models, and inform 
policy analysis.  System inputs require existing NRP data which provide an 
acceptable level of precision and quality for an acceptable level of data 
quality output.",In production: less than one year
"Predictive equipment 
maintenance system","Predictive maintenance to increase equipment uptime, improve safety, 
lower maintenance cost. Researching feasibility and tools.",Initiation
TAS Virtual Assistant,"The TAS Virtual Assistant Chatbot will capture utterances from 
taxpayers/end-users to direct them to helpful resources on IRS and TAS 
public websites.",Initiation
"Taxpayer Accessibility - 
Machine Translation (MT)","Taxpayer Accessibility Machine Translation (MT) is a SaaS based 
Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) product that uses Amazon Translate, a 
neural machine translation (NMT) service. The MT solution implements 
customization features in the product which will have capabilities to 
integrate existing Linguistics Policies Tools and Services (LPTS) translations 
and workflows through a centralized repository formed by a collection of 
existing and customized IRS glossaries to return translations from English 
to Spanish (and Spanish to English) that more accurately reflect native-
tongue verbiage.",Implementation
