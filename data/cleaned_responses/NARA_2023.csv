AI Pilot Project to Screen and Flag for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Digitized Archival Records,Information Service ,"The NARA Information Service (I) team collaborating with the Office of Innovation (V), Research Services (R), and the Office of General Counsel (NGC) on a pilot project to use artificial intelligence (AI) tools available on the Amazon Web Services Platform (AWS) and/or Google Cloud Platform to identify and redact Social Security Numbers, Dates of Birth, and other personally identifiable information (PII) in digitized archival records. 

This pilot project will screen digitized pages already in the National Archives Catalog (NAC or the Catalog) and both internal NARA and external partner digitized pages that are in the queue to be added to the Catalog. PII Detection pilot can detect PII information in all documents and parent document groups that have National Archives Identifier (NAID) associated with them and are accessible via NARA Catalog API. PII Detection pilot uses a weighted scoring algorithm to rank the documents with most sensitive information (defined by agency needs) with higher scores. 

Agency further plans to enhance this prototype into a User Interface driven tool that can be used by the Legal, Business and Security team to run preliminary scans on unpublished Information. Agency also plans to enhance to this prototype by further adding custom entities for detection.",Planned (not in production),"1. Textraction Machine Learning (ML) service which used OCR to extract the text/data from scanned images
2. Automated NLP (Natural Language processing) to detect PII information out of the extracted text from scanned images."
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Discovery AI Pilot,NGC FOIA Office,"NARA would like to utilize various AI techniques to respond to FOIA requests. The AI system will do two things. First, the AI system would offer an NLP based search technique based on the content similarity between the query and the content of the records. The second main AI application would be to redact based on the nature of the FOIA request. Most of the time, the personal information is redacted, but additional information would also need to be redacted based on the requester.  ",Planned (not in production),AI based Vector search or Content similarity search. 
Auto-fill of Descriptive Metadata for Archival Descriptions ,Information Service ,"Archival descriptions or Self-describing records is the process of filling out descriptive metadata for the records that will be released to the public. When records are released to the public, the records need to be described with summary, authorities and other fields that would allow the records to be surfaced during a search. NARA has released millions of pages of records to the public via the National Archives Catalog at catalog.archives.gov.  Most of the records have very minimal set of descriptive metadata as it is a very intensive manual process. The self-describing records will look at the content of the document and the various available metadata from the records management system such as originating agency etc. and predict values for the descriptive metadata. ",Planned (not in production),Standard Machine learning to predict values for descriptive metadata fields given various inputs such as the content and metadata from the records management system. 
Automated Data Discovery and Classification Pilot ,Information Service ,"NARA is planning to conduct a future pilot to test AI/ML based automated data discovery and classification using public/mock-up datasets. In this pilot we will also test both supervised and un-supervised AI/ML techniques.

We’re planning to use vendor’s COTS solution/ML algorithms ""document classifier"" which allows the customer to search and discover full documents rather than individual sensitive data elements such as SSN or credit card numbers.  This technique allows for the ""finding"" of discovery to be a document.  Our customers can search for and discover all their RFPs, purchase orders, NDAs, financial statements, budget documents, resumes, etc.  In cases where NARA has a document type in mind that vendor’s COTS solution does not already understand, we should be able to assemble a learning set of documents (typically 20 - 100 examples) and train the vendor algorithm to find all documents of that type.",Planned (not in production),"Document/File Classification:  Document/file classification is a supervised ML algorithm that classifies whole documents according to their type. The algorithm works by converting each document to a term frequency–inverse document frequency (tf-idf) numerical representation and passing these vectors through a multi-layer neural network to finally get the document’s type/class. 

Document/File Clustering: Document/file clustering is an unsupervised ML algorithm that groups similar files together according to their content. For example, non-disclosure agreements will cluster together while product presentation files will be assigned to a different cluster. "
"Semantic Search for National Archives Catalog - an Artificial
Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) Pilot Program",Information Service ,"The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is responsible for preserving and
providing access to the records of the United States federal government. The NARA Catalog
contains millions of records and documents critical to researchers, historians, and the general
public and finding the correct records or documents can be a time-consuming and challenging task. 

Semantic search can solve this problem by allowing users to search the catalog using natural language queries. Semantic search is a data searching technique that not only finds the matching keywords based on user search terms but also understands the user’s intent and contextual meaning behind the search terms. Semantic search can also help to improve the accuracy and relevance of search results. By analyzing the meaning and context of search queries, semantic search can provide more accurate and relevant results than traditional keyword-based search methods. This can help researchers and historians to find the records and documents they need more quickly and easily.

Additionally, semantic search can help to identify the relationships between records and documents in the NARA catalog. This can help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the historical events and processes represented in the records and can facilitate new insights and discoveries.",Planned (not in production),
