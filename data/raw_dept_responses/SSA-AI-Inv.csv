Use Case Name,Bureau / Department,Summary of Use Case
Insight,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight; Office of Hearing Operations, Office of Disability Systems","Insight is decision support software used by hearings and appeals-level Disability Program adjudicators to help maximize the quality, speed, and consistency of their decision making.  Insight analyzes the free text of disability decisions and other case data to offer adjudicators real-time alerts on potential quality issues and case-specific reference information within a web application.  It also offers adjudicators a series of interactive tools to help streamline their work.  Adjudicators can leverage these features to speed their work and fix issues before the case moves forward (e.g. to another reviewing employee or to the claimant).  Insight’s features are powered by several natural language processing and artificial intelligence packages and techniques."
Intelligent Medical Language Analysis Generation (IMAGEN),"Office of Disability Determinations, Office of Disability Information Systems","IMAGEN is an IT Modernization Disability Analytics & Disability Decision Support (ADDS) Product that will provide new tools and services to visualize, search and more easily identify relevant clinical content in medical records.  These tools and services will improve the efficiency and consistency of disability determinations and decisions and provide a foundation for machine-based decisional guidance. IMAGEN will transform text to data and enable disability adjudicators to leverage various machine learning technologies like Natural Language Processing (NLP) and predictive analytics and will support other high-priority agency initiatives such as fraud prevention and detection."
Duplicate Identification Process (DIP),"Office of Disability Information Systems,  Office of Hearing Operations, Office of Appellate Operations","Duplicate Identification Process's (DIP's) objective is to help the user to identify and flag and mark duplicates more efficiently, reducing the amount of time spent to review cases for hearings. DIP uses artificial intelligence software in the form of image recognition technology to accurately identify duplicates consistent with SSA policy.?"
Handwriting recognition from forms,"Office of Disability Information Systems,  Office of Hearing Operations, Office of Appellate Operations",AI performs OCR against handwritten entries on specific standard forms submitted by clients. This use case is in support of an Robtic Process Automation effort as well as a standalone use.
Modernized Development Worksheet (MDW),"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This process uses AI to review textual data that is part of claim development tasks so it can be categorized into workload topics using natural language processing to facilitate faster technician review.
Anomalous iClaim Predictive Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",The anomalous iClaim predictive model is a machine learning model that identifies high-risk iClaims. These claims are then sent to Operations for further review before additional action is taken to adjudicate the claims. 
Pre-Effectuation Review / Targeted Denial Review Models,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",These review models use machine learning to identify cases with greatest likelihood of disability eligibility determination error and refer them for quality review checks.  
Rep Payee Misuse Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This model uses machine learning to estimate the probability of resource misuse by representative payees and flag the cases for a technician to examine.
CDR Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This model uses machine learning techniques to identify disability cases with the greatest likelihood of medical improvement and flag them for a coninuing disability review.
SSI Redetermination Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This model uses machine learning to identify supplemental security income cases with highest expected overpayments due to changes in financial eligibility and flag them for technician review.  
Medicare Part D Subsidy Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This model uses machine learning to identify cases most likely to have incorrect Medicare Part D subsidies and flag them for technician review.
PATH Model,"Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight ",This model uses machine learning to identify cases likely to receive an allowance at the hearing level and refer them to administrative law judges or senior adjudicators for prioritized review.
Quick Disability Determinations Process,Office of Retirement of Disability Programs ,"The Quick Disability Determinations (QDD) process uses a computer-based predictive model to screen initial applications to identify cases where a favorable disability determination is highly likely and medical evidence is readily available. The Agency bases the QDD model’s predictive scores on historical data from application forms completed by millions of applicants. By identifying QDD cases early in the process, the Social Security Administration can prioritize this workload and expedite case processing.  The Agency routinely refines the QDD model to reflect the characteristics of the recent applicant population and optimize its ability to identify strong candidates for expedited processing. "
Mobile Wage Reporting (MOBWR) ,Office of Systems,Mobile Wage Reporting uses AI to extract text/data from scanned images/documents represeting pay stubs or payroll information to enable faster processing.
