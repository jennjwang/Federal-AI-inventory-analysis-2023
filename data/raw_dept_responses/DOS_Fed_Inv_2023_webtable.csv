R,SentiBERTIQ,"GEC A&R uses deep contextual AI of text to identify and extract subjective information within the source material. This sentiment model was trained by fine-tuning a multilingual, BERT model leveraging word embeddings across 2.2 million labeled tweets spanning English, Spanish, Arabic, and traditional and simplified Chinese. The tool will assign a sentiment to each text document and output a CSV containing the sentiment and confidence interval for user review."
R,TOPIQ,"GEC A&R’s TOPIQ tool automatically classifies text into topics for analyst review and interpretation. The tool uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a natural language processing technique that uncovers a specified number of topics from a collection of documents, and then assigns the probability that each document belongs to a topic."
R,Text Similarity,GEC A&R’s Text Similarity capability identified different texts that are identical or nearly identical by calculating cosine similarity between each text. Texts are then grouped if they share high cosine similarity and then available for analysts to review further.

This bot is now used to update ~300 FPDS awards per week.  A/LM also partnered with WHA to develop a bot to automate closeout reminders for federal assistance grants nearing the end of the period of performance and begin developing bots to automate receiving report validation and customer service inbox monitoring."
A,Product Service Code Automation ML Model,"A/LM developed a machine learning model to scan unstructured, user entered procurement data such as Requisition Title and Line Descriptions to automatically detect the commodity and services types being purchased for enhanced procurement categorization."
A,Tailored Integration Logistics Management System (ILMS) User Analytics,A/LM plans to use available ILMS transactional data and planned transactions to develop tailored user experiences and analytics to meet the specifics needs of the user at that moment. By mining real system actions and clicks we can extract more meaningful information about our users to simplify their interactions with the system and reduce time to complete their daily actions.
A,Supply Chain Fraud and Risk Models,"A/LM plans to expand current risk analytics through development of AI/ML models for detecting anomalous activity within the Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS) that could be potential fraud or malfeasance. The models will expand upon existing risk models and focus on key supply chain functions such as: Asset Management, Procure-to-Pay, and Fleet Management."
A,Tailored Integration Logistics Management System (ILMS) Automated User Support Bot,ILMS developed and deployed an automated support desk assistant using ServiceNow Virtual Agent to simplify support desk interactions for ILMS customers and to deflect easily resolved issues from higher cost support desk agents.
PM,NLP to pull key information from unstructured text,Use NLP to extract information such as country names and agreement dates from dozens of pages of unstructured pdf document
PM,K-Means clustering into tiers,Cluster countries into tiers based off data collected from open source and bureau data using k-means clustering
CSO,Automated Burning Detection,The Village Monitoring System program uses AI and machine learning to conduct daily scans of moderate resolution commercial satellite imagery to identify anomalies using the near-infrared band.
CSO,Automated Damage Assessments,"The Conflict Observatory program uses AI and machine learning on moderate and high-resolution commerical satellite imagery to document a variety of war crimes and other abuses in Ukraine, including automated damage assessments of a variety of buildings, including critical infrastructure, hospitals, schools, crop storage facilities."
A,Within Grade Increase Automation,"A Natural Language Processing (NLP) model is used in coordination with Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) to identify and extract values from the JF-62 form for within grade increase payroll actions. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is then used to validate the data against existing reports, then create a formatted file for approval and processing."
A,Verified Imagery Pilot Project,"The Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations ran a pilot project to test how the use of a technology service, Sealr, could verify the delivery of foreign assistance to conflict-affected areas where neither U.S. Department of State nor our implementing partner could go.  Sealr uses blockchain encryption to secure photographs taken on smartphones from digital tampering.  It also uses artificial intelligence to detect spoofs, like taking a picture of a picture of something.  Sealr also has some image recognition capabilities.  The pilot demonstrated technology like Sealr can be used as a way to strengthen remote monitoring of foreign assistance to dangerous or otherwise inaccessible areas."
A,Conflict Forecasting,"CSO/AA is developing a suite of conflict and instability forecasting models that use open-source political, social, and economic datasets to predict conflict outcomes including interstate war, mass mobilization, and mass killings. The use of AI is confined to statistical models including machine learning techniques including tree-based methods, neural networks, and clustering approaches."
