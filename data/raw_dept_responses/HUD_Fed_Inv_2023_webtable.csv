HUD,Consolidated Plan Pilot Analysis,"In March 2023, PD&R began a pilot project to analyze aspects of HUD's Consolidated Plans. HUD requires grantees of its formula block grant programs to submit Consolidated Plans, which are meant to identify and assess affordable housing and community development needs and market conditions. These plans are publicly available via HUD's website. HUD staff currently review these plans for compliance, but HUD lacks the capacity to do in-depth analysis of commonalities or trends contained within plans. This pilot project will explore creating a database and chat-bot that will enable HUD staff to query features of the nearly 1,000 active Consolidated Plans. This pilot exercise has the potential to inform grantees, technical assistance, and other programmatic tweaks, as well as inform how advanced data science tools can benefit our programs and operations."
