EPA,,,Use of random forest model to predict exposure pathways,"Prioritizing the potential risk posed to human health by chemicals requires tools that can estimate exposure from limited information. In this study, chemical structure and physicochemical properties were used to predict the probability that a chemical might be associated with any of four exposure pathways leading from sources-consumer (near-field), dietary, far-field industrial, and far-field pesticide-to the general population. The balanced accuracies of these source-based exposure pathway models range from 73 to 81%, with the error rate for identifying positive chemicals ranging from 17 to 36%. We then used exposure pathways to organize predictions from 13 different exposure models as well as other predictors of human intake rates. We created a consensus, meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework in which the predictors of exposure were combined by pathway and weighted according to predictive ability for chemical intake rates inferred from human biomonitoring data for 114 chemicals. The consensus model yields an R2 ofÂ â¼0.8. We extrapolate to predict relevant pathway(s), median intake rate, and credible interval for 479 926 chemicals, mostly with minimal exposure information. This approach identifies 1880 chemicals for which the median population intake rates may exceed 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight/day, while there is 95% confidence that the median intake rate is below 1 Î¼g/kg BW/day for 474572 compounds.

Toward that end, the NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis built a machine learning system that detects whether a paper is
likely to be cited by a future clinical trial or guideline. Despite the noisiness of citation dynamics, as little as 2 years of
postpublication data yield accurate predictions about a paperâs eventual citation by a clinical article (accuracy = 84%, F1
score = 0.56; compared to 19% accuracy by chance). We found that distinct knowledge flow trajectories are linked to

The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of Stateâs monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the A-number. This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable. The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to more confidently create connections between petitioners and their families based on limited data.

Additionally, it will be able to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases the only similar fields are a common address.

Interior,USGS,,"Updating Real-time Earthquake Shaking, Ground Failure, and Impact products with remote sensing and ground truth observations","A breakthrough for rapid post-earthquake ground failure (GF) and loss modeling and reporting has been achieved with initial Bayesian updating of our global loss and GF models with ground-truth observations. Empirical models suffer from limited performance due to the complex, event-specific causal effects underlying the cascading processes of earthquake-triggered hazards and impacts. In contrast, satellite imagery-based impact assessments (e.g., NASAâs Damage Proxy Maps, or DPMs), while spatially accurate, lack the specificity as to what physical process caused those image changes. We present the first rapid seismic multi-hazard and damage updating framework based on variational Bayesian causal inference and remotely sensed DPMs. This machine learning framework enables accurate and high-resolution multi-hazard and damage estimates by jointly inferring shaking and secondary hazards and resulting building damage and quantifying their causal dependencies from imagery and prior loss and GF models. The underlying physical causal dependencies are modeled using a multi-layer causal Bayesian network. Initial results are impressive, showing that our framework significantly improves the GF prediction abilities. It also reveals the event-specific causal dependencies among ground shaking, GF, building damage, and other environmental factors. We expect improved PAGER products to more rapidly evolve to accurate and thus more actionable images, maps, and products. ",Planned (not in production),David Wald,wald@usgs.gov

We select eight GBM-based ground-motion models that have the lowest root mean squared error (rmse) for the cross-validation datasets among models with the same number of explanatory variables. The secondary variables, in order of importance, that contribute to the model accuracy are: VS30, Ztor, Ry, Rx, Rake, Zhyp, and Dip. By considering the tradeoff between the model accuracy and model complexity (number of explanatory variables), we find an optimal model to predict PGA and PGV uses four explanatory variables: M, Rjb, VS30, and Ztor.

We use an existing deep learning model for earthquake detection and phase picking called EQTransformer, which was trained on a global data set of earthquake waveforms called STEAD, using the TensorFlow library.  We also apply deep learning methods for earthquake location (EikoNet and HypoSVI), trained on a known velocity model with a physics informed neural network using the PyTorch library, which then allows grid-free rapid seismic wave travel time calculation between any 2 locations within a 3D volume .  These machine learning methods for automatic earthquake detection, phase-picking, and location, which are all available as open-source Python codes, help increase the number of small earthquake observations and improve earthquake depth estimates, thus offering more detailed information about active faults and physical processes in this earthquake sequence.",Planned (not in production),"Yoon, Clara",cyoon@usgs.gov

USAID,USAID,"USAID/Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI)",Long-term impacts of land-use/land-cover dynamics on surface water quality in Botswanaâs reservoirs using satellite data and artificial intelligence methods: Case study of the Botswanaâs Limpopo River Basin (1984-2019),"For water supply, semi-arid Botswana relies on the reservoirs within the Botswanaâs LRB. Reservoirs are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) activities and runoff because of their complex dynamics, relatively longer water residence times, and their role as an integrating sink for pollutants from their drainage basins. Despite these interrelationships and significance in regional and global economic stability, land and water (L-W) are often treated in âsilosâ. To understand the complex L-W nexus within the LRB, this study will use data-driven artificial intelligence for quantitative determination of the relationships between LULC change, together with socioeconomic development indicators and climate change, and their impacts on water quality and availability within the basin, both for 1984-2019 and to predict future scenarios (2020-2050). To advance data acquisition for LULC analysis and climate change, the study utilizes optical Earth-observation and meteorological satellite data. To provide near real-time and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of reservoir water quality within the basin, the study will develop empirical models for water quality estimation and water quality index mapping using 35-years of in-situ water quality measurements and water spectral observations using drone-borne spectrometer and optical satellite imagery through regression modeling and geospatial methods.",Development and Acquisition,"Vachhani, Ankit",AI@usaid.gov
USAID,USAID,"USAID/Bureau for Development, Democracy, and Innovation (DDI)",Morogoro youth empowerment through establishment of social innovation (YEESI) lab for problem-centered training in machine vision,"The project proposes to establish a social innovation lab for a machine vision program that will be used by youth in the Morogoro region of Tanzania. There are young people in the area who have studied information technologies and allied sciences, and while most of them can write computer programs, they cannot solve machine vision problems. This project aims to increase awareness among the youth of Morogoro and nearby regions to address machine vision problems in agriculture. Machine vision is a new and understudied practice in Tanzania; hence, this project will contribute to efforts in the creation of scientific societies that address the most pressing problems faced by more than 80% of Tanzaniaâs population who engage in farming. The main agricultural problems can be classified into five categories, as explained below: (1) Disease Detection and Classification: The project will develop experts who will solve problems in disease identification using machine vision for most of the diseases in crops and livestock, which are misdiagnosed by farmers. (2) Weed Classification: The project will develop algorithms that accurately identify weeds and contribute to the growing scientific database for automatic weed detection. (3) Pest Detection and Classification: Appropriate tools using machine vision for Integrated Pest Management (IPM) are needed in Tanzania, as IPM has been hindered due to a lack of extension officers to train farmers on mitigation and identification of pests in agriculture. (4) Crop Seedlings Stand Count and Yield Estimation: Use of machine vision and drones instead of scouting manually to estimate stand counts would provide appropriate mitigation strategies for replanting that would be beneficial to commercial farmers. Also of importance are algorithms to sort and estimate yield by counting the fruits and to estimate the amount of other agricultural products. (5) Crop Vigor Estimation: Most farmers apply inputs evenly across the farm because they cannot predetermine crop vigor. Accurate estimation of crop health would help farmers to mitigate the problems earlier and improve crop performance and avoid failure. Algorithms to determine crop vigor developed in this project will contribute to the improvement of the methods to estimate crop performance earlier.",Development and Acquisition,"Vachhani, Ankit",AI@usaid.gov

Using Crimson Hexagonâs machine learning algorithm, âBrightview,â publicly available social media content originating in the countries of interest was scraped by the algorithm, for posts relevant to RH/FP and youth. The resulting social media posts were then classified by topic, using language detected in the content. This provided a dataset categorizing conversations into overarching topics, allowing analyses to uncover key trends in topic specific conversation volume, insights about misinformation, attitudes and social norms, and more. The machine learning algorithm was able to identify relevant social media content. The 12,301 social media posts were qualitatively assessed and categorized, allowing researchers to monitor and track social media conversations far more expansively than allowed by research methods more traditionally used in public health and SBC programs.",Operation and Maintenance,"Vachhani, Ankit",AI@usaid.gov
